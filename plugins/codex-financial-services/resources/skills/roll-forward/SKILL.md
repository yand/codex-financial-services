description: "Build a roll-forward schedule for a balance-sheet account — beginning balance plus activity less reversals equals ending balance, with each component tied to GL. Use for month-end close packages and audit support."

## Codex Adapter Notes

- This skill was adapted from Anthropic's Claude/Cowork financial-services repo.
- Use available Codex tools, local files, web research, spreadsheets, documents, and presentations to perform the workflow.
- Treat referenced commercial MCP providers as optional. If the provider is not configured, ask for user-provided data or use public sources where suitable.
- Claude-specific slash command, agent, hook, and tool names are preserved as source context; map them to equivalent Codex behavior rather than requiring Claude runtime features.

# Roll-forward

Given an account (or account group), entity, and period, produce a roll-forward that ties beginning to ending.

## Structure

```
Beginning balance (per prior-period close)      X
  + Additions / new activity                    A
  + Accruals booked this period                 B
  − Reversals of prior accruals                (C)
  − Payments / settlements                     (D)
  ± Reclasses / adjustments                     E
  ± FX translation                              F
Ending balance (per GL at period end)           Y
```

## Tie each line

- **Beginning** — prior-period close package, or GL balance at prior-period end date.
- **Each activity line** — a GL query (account + date range + journal-source filter) via the internal-gl MCP. Cite the query.
- **Ending** — GL balance at period-end date.

The schedule **must foot**: `X + A + B − C − D + E + F = Y`. If it doesn't, the gap is an unexplained item — surface it, don't plug it.

## Output

The roll-forward table with a "ties to" column citing the GL query or document for every line, plus a foot check (pass/fail and the unexplained delta if any).
