description: "Codex adapter for Claude slash command /analyze-swap-curve from lseg. Use when the user types /analyze-swap-curve or asks to analyze the swap curve with government and inflation overlays to identify curve trade opportunities"

## Codex Adapter Notes

- This skill was adapted from Anthropic's Claude/Cowork financial-services repo.
- Use available Codex tools, local files, web research, spreadsheets, documents, and presentations to perform the workflow.
- Treat referenced commercial MCP providers as optional. If the provider is not configured, ask for user-provided data or use public sources where suitable.
- Claude-specific slash command, agent, hook, and tool names are preserved as source context; map them to equivalent Codex behavior rather than requiring Claude runtime features.

Source: `plugins/partner-built/lseg/commands/analyze-swap-curve.md`

When this skill triggers, execute the workflow below in Codex. Ask only for missing business inputs that cannot be inferred from the user's prompt or available files.

# Analyze Swap Curve

> This command uses LSEG swap pricing, interest rate curves, and inflation curve tools. See [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md) for available tools.

Build and analyze the interest rate swap curve, overlay government yields and inflation breakevens, and identify curve trade opportunities.

See the **swap-curve-strategy** skill for domain knowledge on curve analysis and trade construction.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Input

Ask the user for:
- Currency (required) — e.g., EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, JPY
- Reference rate index (optional) — e.g., ESTR, SOFR, SONIA, TONA
- Valuation date (optional, defaults to today)

### 2. Discover Swap Templates

Call `ir_swap` in list mode with the currency and optional index.

Extract: available template references, index details, conventions.

### 3. Build the Swap Curve

Call `ir_swap` in price mode for standard tenors: 2Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, 30Y.

Extract: par swap rate and DV01 at each tenor.

### 4. Overlay the Government Curve

Call `interest_rate_curve` (list then calculate) for the same currency.

Compute swap spread = swap rate minus government yield at each tenor.

### 5. Decompose Real Rates

Call `inflation_curve` (search then calculate) for the currency.

Compute real swap rate = nominal swap rate minus inflation breakeven at each tenor.

### 6. Synthesize Curve Strategy Views

Compute curve metrics: 2s10s slope, 5s30s slope, 2s5s10s butterfly.

Identify opportunities: steepener, flattener, butterfly, or swap spread trades based on current levels vs historical norms.

Present: swap curve table with government overlay, curve metrics, real rate decomposition, and trade recommendations with DV01-neutral ratios.

## Output Format

Lead with curve shape summary and key metrics (2s10s, butterfly). Follow with detailed tables and trade idea section.
